# Error and logging files

When you run a simulation, EMOD will output basic error and logging information to help track
the progress and help debug any issues that may occur. If you run the simulation on an HPC
cluster, the cluster will generate additional logging and error files. See [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)
if you need help resolving an error.

## Status

A status.txt file will be saved to the *working directory* that provides one
output line per time step and includes the total run time of the simulation. A simulation
with 50 time steps will look something like this:

```

## Standard output

When you run a simulation, it will generate a standard output logging file
(StdOut.txt) in the working directory that captures all standard output messages.

The file contains information about a particular simulation, such as the EMOD version used and
the files in use, as well as other initialization information, including the default logging level
and the logging levels set for particular modules. The file follows that information
with log output using the following format: <timestep><HPC rank><log level><module><message>.

By default, the logging level is set to "INFO". If you want to change the logging level, see [emod:dev-debug-logging](emod:dev-debug-logging.md).

## Standard error

When you run a simulation, it will also generate a standard error logging file
(StdErr.txt) in the working directory that captures all standard error messages.

## Configuration parameters

The following parameters control logging behavior and can be set in your configuration file.

| Parameter | Data type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `logLevel_default` | enum | INFO | The default log level for all modules. See [Log levels](#log-levels) below. |
| `logLevel_<ModuleName>` | enum | INFO | Override the log level for a specific EMOD module, identified by the class name shown in StdOut.txt. Overrides `logLevel_default` for that module only. |
| `Enable_Log_Throttling` | boolean | 0 | When set to 1, eliminates duplicate log messages from the same source file, retaining only the first occurrence of each repeated message. |
| `Enable_Continuous_Log_Flushing` | boolean | 0 | When set to 1, flushes the log buffer to disk after every message. Useful when diagnosing crashes that may cut off buffered log output before it is written. |
| `Enable_Warnings_Are_Fatal` | boolean | 0 | When set to 1, warning-level log messages are treated as fatal errors and will terminate the simulation. |

## Log levels

There are five log levels. The level chosen will log messages at that level and all higher levels
(lower numeric value). You can set the default log level for all modules using `logLevel_default`
and override it for individual modules using `logLevel_<ModuleName>`.

**ERROR (1)**
:   Only errors are logged. This is the least verbose level.

**WARNING (2)**
:   Warnings and errors are logged.

**INFO (3)**
:   The default level. Informational messages, warnings, and errors are logged. This is
    the recommended level for normal use and provides the output needed to diagnose most issues.

**DEBUG (4)**
:   Debug messages, informational messages, warnings, and errors are logged. This setting
    generates a large volume of output and may impact simulation performance. When using
    this level, consider applying it to individual modules rather than setting it as the default.

**VALID (5)**
:   The most verbose level. Includes validation and low-level debug messages, in addition to all
    higher-level messages. Because of the potential performance impact, this level only produces
    output in a debug build of Eradication.exe.

## Controlling log output size

When running large numbers of simulations — for example, parameter sweeps with thousands of runs —
the StdOut.txt file from each simulation can add up to significant disk usage. Setting
`logLevel_default` to `WARNING` or `ERROR` reduces the volume of log output and can meaningfully
reduce total disk usage.

The tradeoff is that if a simulation fails or produces unexpected results, the reduced log output
may not contain enough information to diagnose the problem. If you need to investigate an issue,
re-run the simulation with `logLevel_default` set to `INFO` (or omit the parameter entirely to
use the default) to get the full output needed for diagnosis.

A middle ground is to reduce the default level but keep specific modules at `INFO`. For example:

```json
{
    "logLevel_default": "WARNING",
    "logLevel_Eradication": "INFO"
}
```

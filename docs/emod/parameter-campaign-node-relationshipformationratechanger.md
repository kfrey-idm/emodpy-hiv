# RelationshipFormationRateChanger

The **RelationshipFormationRateChanger** node intervention class allows the user to change 
the rate at which relationships form in a node. This allows the user to model, for example, how 
an education program or other intervention causes people to reduce the number of relationships they create. 
This intervention overrides the **Formation_Rate_Constant** value in the Demographics file that 
typically determines this rate (**Formation_Rate_Type** is assumed to be 'CONSTANT'). 
Note, this intervention does not expire; it causes an existing intervention to be removed. Hence, to reset the 
parameter, the user should submit a second intervention with the original value. This change impacts the 
relationships one time step after it was distributed.

!!! note
    Parameters are case-sensitive. For Boolean parameters, set to 1 for true or 0 for false.
    Minimum, maximum, or default values of "NA" indicate that those values are not applicable for
    that parameter.

    EMOD does not use true defaults; that is, if the dependency relationships indicate that a parameter is required, you must supply a value for it. However, many of the tools used to work with EMOD will use the default values provided below.

    JSON format does not permit comments, but you can add "dummy" parameters to add contextual
    information to your files. Any keys that are not EMOD parameter names will be ignored by the
    model.

The table below describes all possible parameters with which this class can be configured. The JSON
example that follows shows one potential configuration.

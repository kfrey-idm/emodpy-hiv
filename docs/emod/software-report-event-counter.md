# ReportEventCounter

The event counter report (ReportEventCounter.json) is a JSON-formatted file that keeps track of how
many of each event types occurs during a time step. The report produced is similar to the
InsetChart.json channel report, where there is one channel for each event defined in the
configuration file (config.json). This report only counts events; a similar report,
[ReportEventRecorder](software-report-event-recorder.md), will provide information about the person at the time of the
event.

## Configuration

The following parameters need to be configured to generate the report:

{{ read_csv('../csv/report-event-counter.csv', keep_default_na=False) }}

```json
{
    "Reports": [{
        "class": "ReportEventCounter",
        "Filename_Suffix": "Node1",
        "Start_Day": 365,
        "End_Day": 465,
        "Node_IDs_Of_Interest": [ 1 ],
        "Min_Age_Years": 5,
        "Max_Age_Years": 10,
        "Must_Have_IP_Key_Value": "Risk:HIGH",
        "Must_Have_Intervention": "SimpleVaccine",
        "Event_Trigger_List": [
            "NewInfectionEvent",
            "NewClinicalCase"
        ]
    }],
    "Use_Defaults": 1
}
```

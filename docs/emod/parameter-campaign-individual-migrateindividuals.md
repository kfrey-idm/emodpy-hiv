# MigrateIndividuals


The **MigrateIndividuals** intervention class is an individual-level intervention used to force
migration and is separate from the normal migration system. However, it does require that human
migration is enabled by setting the configuration parameters **Migration_Model** to
FIXED_RATE_MIGRATION and **Migration_Pattern** to SINGLE_ROUND_TRIP.

As individuals migrate, there are three ways to categorize nodes:

* Home: the node where the individuals reside; each individual has a single home node.
* Origin: the "starting point" node for each leg of the migration. The origin updates as individuals
  move between nodes.
* Destination: the node the individual is traveling to. The destination updates as individuals move
  between nodes.

For example, Individual 1 has a home node of Node A. They migrate from Node A to Node B. Node A is
both the home node and the origin node, and Node B is the destination node. If Individual 1 migrates
from Node B to Node C, Node A remains the home node, but now Node B is the origin node, and Node C
is the destination node. If Individual 1 migrates from Node C back to Node A, Node C is the origin
node, and Node A becomes the destination node and still remains the home node.

!!! note
    Parameters are case-sensitive. For Boolean parameters, set to 1 for true or 0 for false.
    Minimum, maximum, or default values of "NA" indicate that those values are not applicable for
    that parameter.

    EMOD does not use true defaults; that is, if the dependency relationships indicate that a parameter is required, you must supply a value for it. However, many of the tools used to work with EMOD will use the default values provided below.

    JSON format does not permit comments, but you can add "dummy" parameters to add contextual
    information to your files. Any keys that are not EMOD parameter names will be ignored by the
    model.

The table below describes all possible parameters with which this class can be configured. The JSON
example that follows shows one potential configuration.

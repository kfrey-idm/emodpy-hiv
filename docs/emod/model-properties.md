# Individual and node properties

One of the strengths of an agent-based model, as opposed to a compartmental model governed by ODEs,
is that you can introduce heterogeneity in individuals and regions. For example, you can define
property values for accessibility, age, geography, risk, and other properties and assign these
values to individuals or nodes in the simulation.

These properties are most commonly used to target (or avoid targeting) particular nodes or
individuals with interventions. For example, you might want to put individuals into different age
bins and then target interventions to individuals in a particular age bin. Another common use is to
configure treatment coverage to be higher for nodes that are easy to access and lower for nodes that
are difficult to access. For more information on creating campaign interventions, see
[Creating campaigns](model-campaign.md).

For HIV simulations, transmission is configured using mechanistic parameter settings, such as parasite
density, viral load, biting frequency, and other measures relevant to the disease being modeled. See
[Infectivity configuration](parameter-configuration-infectivity.md) for more information.

The following sections describe how to define individual properties and assign different values to
individuals in a simulation. However, with the exception of setting up age bins, you can use the
same process to assign properties to a node. To see all individual and node property
parameters, see [NodeProperties and IndividualProperties](parameter-demographics.md#nodeproperties-and-individualproperties).

## Create individual properties other than age

Assigning property values to individuals uses the **IndividualProperties** parameter in the
demographics file. See [Demographics parameters](parameter-demographics.md) for a list of supported properties. The values
you assign to properties are user-defined and can be applied to individuals in all nodes or only in
particular nodes in a simulation.

Note that although EMOD provides several different properties, such as risk and accessibility,
these properties do not add logic, in and of themselves, to the simulation. For example, if you
define individuals as high and low risk, that does not add different risk factors to the
individuals. Higher prevalence or any other differences must be configured separately. Therefore,
the different properties are merely suggestions and can be used to track any property you like.

1.  In the demographics file, add the **IndividualProperties** parameter and set it to an empty array.
    If you want the values to apply to all nodes, add it in the **Defaults** section; if you want the
    values to be applied to specific nodes, add it to the **Nodes** section.

1.  In the array, add an empty JSON object. Within it, do the following:

    2.  Add the **Property** parameter and set it to one of the supported values.

    2.  Add the **Values** parameter and set it to an array of possible values that can
        be assigned to individuals. You can define any string value here.

    2.  Add the **Initial_Distribution** parameter and set it to an array of numbers that add
        up to 1. This configures the initial distribution of the values assigned to individuals
        in one or all nodes.

1.  If you want to add another property and associated values, add a new JSON object in the
    **IndividualProperties** array as above.

!!! note
    Multiple properties must be defined in one file. They can be defined in either the base
    layer demographics file or an overlay file, but they cannot be split between the files.
    The maximum number of property types that can be added is two.

## Create properties for age ranges

Creating properties based on age ranges works a little differently than other properties.
**Age_Bin** is tied to the simulated age of an individual rather than being an independent property.
Some of its characteristics, such as initial distribution and transitions, are dependent on
information from the demographics file and EMOD that manages individual aging during the
simulation.

1.  In the demographics file, add the **IndividualProperties** parameter and set it to an empty array.
    If you want the values to apply to all nodes, add it in the **Defaults** section; if you want the
    values to be applied to specific nodes, add it to the **Nodes** section.

1.  In the array, add an empty JSON object. Within it, do the following:

    2.  Add the **Property** parameter and set it to "Age_Bin".

    2.  Add the **Age_Bin_Edges_In_Years** parameter and set it to an array that contains a comma-
        delimited list of integers in ascending order that define the boundaries used for each of
        the age bins, in years. The first number must always be 0 (zero) to indicate the age at
        birth and the last number must be -1 to indicate the maximum age in the simulation.

The example below shows how to set up several property values based on disease risk and physical
place. It also defines three age bins: 0 to 5 years, older than 5 to 13, and older than 13 to the
maximum age.

*See example: [howto-demographics-groups.json](../json/howto-demographics-groups.json)*


## Create node properties


Node properties work the same way as individual properties but are assigned to *nodes* rather than
individuals. They are useful for targeting node-level interventions to subsets of nodes. For example,
you might tag nodes by intervention status so that a campaign can target only nodes that have not
yet been sprayed.

Node properties are defined in the top-level **NodeProperties** array in the demographics file.
This array sits at the same level as **Defaults** and **Nodes** -- it is *not* nested inside either
of them.

> **NOTE:**
> The **Transitions** and **TransmissionMatrix** parameters available for **IndividualProperties**
> are not supported for **NodeProperties**. Node property values can only be changed at runtime
> using the **NodePropertyValueChanger** campaign intervention.


### NodeProperties array format

Each entry in the **NodeProperties** array defines one property category with its possible values
and the probability distribution used to assign values to nodes at the start of the simulation.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Property** | string | The property type name. Must be one of the supported property types: ``Accessibility``, ``Geographic``, ``InterventionStatus``, ``Place``, ``Risk``, or ``QualityOfCare``. |
| **Values** | array of strings | User-defined values that can be assigned to nodes for this property. Up to 125 values for ``Geographic`` and ``InterventionStatus``; up to 5 for others. |
| **Initial_Distribution** | array of floats | The probability of each value being assigned to a node. Must sum to 1.0 and have the same number of entries as **Values**. |

```json
{
    "NodeProperties": [
        {
            "Property": "Place",
            "Values": ["RURAL", "URBAN"],
            "Initial_Distribution": [0.6, 0.4]
        },
        {
            "Property": "InterventionStatus",
            "Values": ["NONE", "SPRAYED_A", "SPRAYED_B", "FENCE_AND_TRAP"],
            "Initial_Distribution": [0.4, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1]
        }
    ]
}
```

At the start of the simulation, each node draws its property value randomly from the
**Initial_Distribution**. In the example above, each node has a 60% chance of being assigned
``Place:RURAL`` and a 40% chance of ``Place:URBAN``.


### Override node property values with NodePropertyValues

You can override the random assignment for specific nodes by adding **NodePropertyValues** inside
that node's **NodeAttributes**. This is an array of ``"Property:Value"`` strings that explicitly
assigns one or more property values to the node, bypassing the **Initial_Distribution** for those
properties.

Any property not listed in **NodePropertyValues** still uses the random distribution from
**NodeProperties**.

```json
{
    "NodeProperties": [
        {
            "Property": "Place",
            "Values": ["RURAL", "URBAN"],
            "Initial_Distribution": [0.7, 0.3]
        },
        {
            "Property": "InterventionStatus",
            "Values": ["NONE", "SPRAYED_A", "SPRAYED_B"],
            "Initial_Distribution": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
        }
    ],
    "Nodes": [
        {
            "NodeID": 1,
            "NodeAttributes": {
                "InitialPopulation": 1000,
                "NodePropertyValues": [
                    "Place:URBAN"
                ]
            }
        },
        {
            "NodeID": 2,
            "NodeAttributes": {
                "InitialPopulation": 5000,
                "NodePropertyValues": [
                    "Place:RURAL",
                    "InterventionStatus:SPRAYED_B"
                ]
            }
        },
        {
            "NodeID": 3,
            "NodeAttributes": {
                "InitialPopulation": 2000
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

In this example:

- **Node 1** is explicitly set to ``Place:URBAN``. Its ``InterventionStatus`` is still drawn
  randomly (100% chance of ``NONE`` based on the distribution).
- **Node 2** is explicitly set to ``Place:RURAL`` and ``InterventionStatus:SPRAYED_B``.
- **Node 3** has no overrides, so both properties are drawn from **Initial_Distribution**.


### Use node properties in campaign interventions

Once node properties are defined, you can use them to target or restrict campaign interventions:

- **Node_Property_Restrictions** in the event coordinator targets interventions to nodes with
  specific property values. For example, targeting only nodes with ``InterventionStatus:NONE``.
- **NodePropertyValueChanger** is a node-level intervention that changes a node's property value
  at runtime. For example, changing ``InterventionStatus:NONE`` to ``InterventionStatus:SPRAYED_A``
  after distributing indoor residual spraying to that node.

# FemaleContraceptive

The **FemaleContraceptive** intervention class models contraceptive use among women.
It is an individual-level intervention that reduces fertility for a configurable duration
with a configurable waning efficacy. The **Usage_Duration_Distribution** determines how long
each woman uses the contraceptive, and the **Waning_Config** controls how the efficacy
changes over that period. When a woman stops using the contraceptive, the
**Usage_Expiration_Event** is broadcast.

This intervention applies only when **Birth_Rate_Dependence** in config.json is set to "INDIVIDUAL_PREGNANCIES" or "INDIVIDUAL_PREGNANCIES_BY_AGE_AND_YEAR".

At a glance:

*  **Distributed to:** Individuals (females only)
*  **Time-based expiration:** Yes. It expires when the usage duration expires, which is determined by the **Usage_Duration_Distribution**.
*  **Purge existing:** No. Adding a new intervention of this class will not remove any existing interventions and efficacies will combine as `birth_modifier *= new_birth_modifier`.

!!! note
    Parameters are case-sensitive. For Boolean parameters, set to 1 for true or 0 for false.
    Minimum, maximum, or default values of "NA" indicate that those values are not applicable for
    that parameter.

    EMOD does not use true defaults; that is, if the dependency relationships indicate that a parameter is required, you must supply a value for it. However, many of the tools used to work with EMOD will use the default values provided below.

    JSON format does not permit comments, but you can add "dummy" parameters to add contextual
    information to your files. Any keys that are not EMOD parameter names will be ignored by the
    model.
The table below describes all possible parameters with which this class can be configured. The JSON
example that follows shows one potential configuration.

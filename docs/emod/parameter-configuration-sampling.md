# Sampling

The following parameters determine how a population is sampled in the simulation. While you may
want every agent (individual object) to represent a single person, you can often optimize CPU
time with without degrading the accuracy of the simulation but having an agent represent
multiple people. The sampling rate may be adapted to have a higher or lower sampling rate for
particular regions or age groups.

!!! note
    Parameters are case-sensitive. For Boolean parameters, set to 1 for true or 0 for false.
    Minimum, maximum, or default values of "NA" indicate that those values are not applicable for
    that parameter.

    EMOD does not use true defaults; that is, if the dependency relationships indicate that a parameter is required, you must supply a value for it. However, many of the tools used to work with EMOD will use the default values provided below.

    JSON format does not permit comments, but you can add "dummy" parameters to add contextual
    information to your files. Any keys that are not EMOD parameter names will be ignored by the
    model.

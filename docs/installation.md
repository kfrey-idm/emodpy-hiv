# Install

## Software prerequisites

The following is required:

- Windows or Linux (Mac is loosely supported)
- Python 3.13 (but also supports 3.11–3.14)
- Docker (optional, but highly recommended — required to run EMOD locally on your computer)

### Python

To verify you have the correct version, enter the following command:

```
python --version
```

You should see something similar to the following, and it should start with "3.13":

```
Python 3.13.2
```

If you do not get that, you may need to install Python 3.13. Download it from
[python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or contact your IT support.

### Docker

How you plan to run EMOD determines whether you need Docker. If you are running
simulations on a **shared computing cluster** provided by your institution or
organization, you do not need Docker and can skip this section. If you are running
simulations on **your own computer**, you need Docker.

Installation may require administrative privileges. If you don't have them, you may
need IT support. Follow the instructions on the Docker website for your operating system:

- [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)
- [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/)
- [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)

!!! warning
    Installing Docker can require downloading close to one gigabyte of data. The first
    time you run EMOD locally it will download another half gigabyte.

#### Windows-specific setup

Enable Developer Mode — required for Docker to work correctly:

**Settings** → **Update & Security** → **For Developers** → select **Developer Mode**

Enable long file path support (only needed if your file paths exceed 255 characters).
This step may also require IT support:

**Local Computer Policy** → **Computer Configuration** → **Administrative Templates**
→ **System** → **Filesystem** → enable **Win32 long paths**

## Setup virtual environment

A [virtual environment](virtual_environments.md) keeps emodpy-hiv's software
separate from other Python projects on your computer, preventing version conflicts.
You will want to do this for all of your new projects.

1. Create the virtual environment:

    ```
    python -m venv env
    ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

    === "Windows"
        ```
        env\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    === "Linux"
        ```bash
        source env/bin/activate
        ```

3. Ensure Python's package installer is up to date:

    ```
    python -m pip install pip --upgrade
    ```

## Install emodpy-hiv

Use the following command to install emodpy-hiv:

```
python -m pip install emodpy-hiv
```

# Glossary



agent-based model
:   A type of simulation that models the actions and interactions of autonomous agents
    (both individual and collective entities such as organizations or groups).

Boost
:   Free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source libraries aimed at a wide range of uses including
    parallel processing applications (Boost.MPI). For more information, please see the
    [Boost website](http://www.boost.org).

boxcar function
:   A mathematical function that is equal to zero over the entire real line except for a single
    interval where it is equal to a constant.

campaign
:   A collection of events that use interventions to modify a simulation.

campaign event
:   A JSON object that determines when and where an intervention is distributed during a campaign.

campaign file
:   A JSON-formatted file that contains the parameters that
    specify the distribution instructions for all interventions used in a campaign, such as
    diagnostic tests, the target demographic, and the timing and cost of interventions. The
    location of this file is specified in the configuration file with the
    **Campaign_Filename** parameter. Typically, the file name is campaign.json.

channel
:   A property of the simulation (for example, Parasite Prevalence) that is accumulated once per
    simulated time step and written to file, typically as an array of the accumulated values.

class factory
:   A function that instantiate objects at run-time and use information
    from JSON-based configuration information in the creation of these objects.

Clausius-Clayperon relation
:   A way of characterizing a transition between two phases of matter; provides a method to find
    a relationship between temperature and pressure along phase boundaries. Frequently used in
    meteorology and climatology to describe the behavior of water vapor.
    See [Wikipedia - Clausius-Clayperon relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation) for more information.

compartmental model
:   A disease model that divides the population into a number of compartments that represent
    different disease states, such as susceptible, infected, or recovered. Every person in a
    compartment is considered identical. Many compartmental models are deterministic,
    but some are stochastic.

configuration file
:   A JSON-formatted file that contains the parameters
    sufficient for initiating a simulation. It controls many different aspects of the
    simulation, such as population size, disease dynamics, and length of the simulation.
    Typically, the file name is config.json.

core
:   In computing, a core refers to an independent central processing unit (CPU) in the computer.
    Multi-core computers have more than one CPU. However, through technologies such as Hyper-Threading
    Technology (HTT or HT), a single physical core can actually act like two virtual
    or logical cores, and appear to the operating system as two processors.

demographics file
:   A JSON-formatted file that contains the parameters that
    specify the demographics of a population, such as age distribution, risk, birthrate, and more.
    IDM provides demographics files for many geographic regions. This file is typically named &lt;region>_demographics.json.

destination node
:   The node an individual or group is traveling to for each leg of the migration. The destination updates as individuals
    move between nodes.

deterministic
:   Characterized by the output being fully determined by the parameter values and the initial
    conditions. Given the same inputs, a deterministic model will always produce the same output.

diffusive migration
:   The diffusion of people in and out of nearby nodes by foot travel.

disability-adjusted life years (DALY)
:   The number of years of life lost due to premature mortality
    plus the years lost due to disability while infected. Used to quantify the burden of disease.

disease-specific build
:   A build of the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) built using SCons without any dynamic link libraries (DLLs).

dynamic link library (DLL)
:   Microsoft's implementation of a shared library, separate from the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe), that can be
    dynamically loaded (and unloaded when unneeded) at runtime. This loading can be explicit or
    implicit.

EMODule
:   A modular component of EMOD that are consumed and used by the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe).
    Under Windows, a EMODule is implemented as a dynamic link library (DLL) and,
    under Linux, EMODules are currently not supported. EMODules are primarily custom reporters.

epidemic
:   An outbreak of an infectious disease, such that a greater number of individuals than normal
    has the disease. Epidemics have very high $R_0$ (Recall $R_0$>1 for a disease to spread) and
    are often associated with acute, highly transmissible pathogens that can be directly transmitted.
    Further, pathogens with lower infectious periods create more explosive epidemics. To control
    epidemics, it is necessary to reduce $R_0$. This can be done by:

    * Reducing transmissibility.
    * Decreasing the number of susceptibles (by vaccination, for example).
    * Decreasing the mean number of contacts or the transmissibility, such as by improving
    sanitation, or limiting the number of interactions sick people have with healthy people.
    * Reducing the length of the infectious period.

Epidemiological MODeling software (EMOD)
:   The modeling software from the Institute for Disease Modeling (IDM) for disease researchers and developers to investigate
    disease dynamics, and to assist in combating a host of infectious diseases. You may see
    this referred to as Disease Transmission Kernel (DTK) in the source code.

Eradication.exe
:   Typical (default) name for the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe), whether built using monolithic build or
    modular (EMODule-enabled) build.

Euler method
:   Used in mathematics and computational science, this method is a first-order numerical
    procedure for solving ordinary differential equations with a given initial value.

event coordinator
:   A JSON object that determines who will receive a particular intervention during a campaign.

exp(
:   The exponential function, $e^x$, where $e$ is the number (approximately 2.718281828)
    such that the function $e^x$ is its own derivative. The exponential function is used to
    model a relationship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same
    proportional change (i.e. percentage increase or decrease) in the dependent variable. The
    function is often written as $exp(x)$. The graph of $y = exp(x)$ is upward-sloping
    and increases faster as $x$ increases.

exposed
:   Individual who has been infected with a pathogen, but due to the pathogen’s incubation
    period, is not yet infectious.

flattened file
:   A single campaign or configuration file created by combining a default file with one or more
    overlay files. Multiple files must be flattened prior to running a simulation. Configuration
    files are flattened to a single-depth JSON file without nesting, the format required for
    consumption by the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe). Separating the parameters into multiple files is primarily
    used for testing and experimentation.

force of infection (FoI)
:   A measure of the degree to which an infected individual can spread infection;
    the per-capita rate at which susceptibles contract infection. Typically increases with
    transmissibility and prevalence of infection.

herd immunity
:   The resistance to the spread of a contagious disease within a population that results if a
    sufficiently high proportion of individuals are immune to the disease, especially through
    vaccination. The portion of the population that needs to be immunized in
    order to achieve herd immunity is  P > 1 – (1/ $R_0$), where P = proportion
    vaccinated * vaccine efficacy.

Heterogeneous Intra-Node Transmission (HINT)
:   A feature for modeling person-to-person transmission of diseases in heterogeneous population
    segments within a node for generic simulations.

high-performance computing (HPC)
:   The use of parallel processing for running advanced applications efficiently, reliably,
    and quickly.

home node
:   The node where the individuals reside; each individual has a single home node.

immune
:   Unable to become infected/infectious, whether through vaccination or having the disease in the
    past.

incidence
:   The rate of new cases of a disease during a specified time period. This is a measure of
    the risk of contracting a disease.

individual properties
:   Labels that can be applied to individuals within a simulation and used to configure
    heterogeneous transmission, target interventions, and move individuals through a health care
    cascade.

infectious
:   Individual who is infected with a pathogen and is capable of transmitting the pathogen to others.

input files
:   The JSON and binary files used as inputs to an EMOD simulation. The primary input files
    are the JSON-formatted configuration, demographics, and campaign files. They may also
    include the binary files for migration, climate, population serialization, or load-
    balancing.

inset chart
:   The default JSON output report for EMOD that includes multiple channels that contain
    data at each time step of the simulation. These channels include number of new infections,
    prevalence, number of recovered, and more.

intervention
:   An object aimed at reducing the spread of a disease that is distributed either to an
    individual; such as a vaccine, drug, or bednet; or to a node; such as a larvicide. Additionally,
    initial disease outbreaks and intermediate interventions that schedule another intervention
    are implemented as interventions in the campaign file.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
:   A human-readable, open standard, text-based file format for data interchange. It is
    typically used to represent simple data structures and associative arrays, and is
    language-independent. For more information, see [json.org](https://www.json.org).

Keyhole Markup Language (KML)
:   A file format used to display geographic data in an Earth browser, for example, Google Maps.
    The format uses an XML-based structure (tag-based structure with nested elements and
    attributes). Tags are case-sensitive.

Link-Time Code Generation (LTCG)
:   A method for the linker to optimize code (for size and/or speed) after compilation has
    occurred. The compiled code is turned not into actual code, but instead into an intermediate
    language form (IL, but not to be confused with .NET IL which has a different purpose). The
    LTCG then, unlike the compiler, can see the whole body of code in all object files and be
    able to optimize the result more effectively.

loss to follow-up (LTFU)
:   Patients who at one point were actively participating in disease treatment or clinical
    research, but have become lost either by error or by becoming unreachable at the point of
    follow-up.

Message Passing Interface (MPI)
:   An interface used to pass information between computing cores in parallel simulations. One
    example is the migration of individuals from one geographic location to another within EMOD
    simulations.

microsolver
:   A type of "miniature model" that operates within the framework of EMOD
    to compute a particular set of parameters. Each microsolver, in effect, is creating a
    microsimulation in order to accurately capture the dynamics of that particular aspect of the
    model.

monolithic build
:   A single EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) with no DLLs that includes all components as
    part of Eradication.exe itself. You can still use EMODules with the monolithic build;
    for example, a custom reporter is a common type of EMODule. View the documentation on
    EMODules and emodules_map.json for more information about creation and use of EMODules.

Monte Carlo method
:   A class of algorithms using repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. Monte
    Carlo simulations create probability distributions for possible outcomes, which provides a
    more realistic way of describing uncertainty.

node
:   A grid size that is used for modeling geographies. Within EMOD, a node is a geographic
    region containing simulated individuals. Individuals migrate between nodes either
    temporarily or permanently using mobility patterns driven by local, regional, and
    long-distance transportation.

node properties
:   Labels that can be applied to nodes within a simulation and used to target interventions based on geography.

node-targeted intervention
:   An intervention that is distributed to a geographical node rather than to a single
    individual. One example is larvicides, which affect all mosquitoes living and feeding within
    a given node.

ordinary differential equation (ODE)
:   A differential equation containing one or more functions of one independent variable and
    its derivatives.

origin node
:   The starting node for each leg of a migration trip. The origin updates as individuals move between nodes.

output report
:   A file that is the output from an EMOD simulation. Output reports are in JSON, CSV, or binary
    file format. You must pass the data from an output report to graphing software if you want to
    visualize the output of a simulation.

overlay file
:   An additional configuration, campaign, or demographic file that overrides the default
    parameter values in the primary file. Separating the parameters into multiple files is
    primarily used for testing a nd experimentation. In the case of configuration and campaign
    files, the files can use an arbitrary hierarchical structure to organize parameters into
    logical groups. Configuration and campaign files must be flattened into a single file before
    running a simulation.

prevalence
:   The rate of all cases of a disease during a specified time period. This is a measure of how
    widespread a disease is.

preview
:   Software that undergoes a shorter testing cycle in order to make it available
    more quickly. Previews may contain software defects that could result in unexpected
    behavior. Use EMOD previews at your own discretion.

recovered
:   An individual who is either no longer infectious, and is removed from the infected population.

regression test
:   A test to verify that existing EMOD functionality works with new
    updates, located in the Regression subdirectory of the EMOD source code repository. Directory names of each
    subdirectory  in Regression describe the main regression attributes, for example,
    "1_Generic_Seattle_MultiNode". Also can refer to the process of regression testing of
    software.

release
:   Software that includes new functionality, scientific tutorials leveraging new or existing
    functionality, and/or bug fixes that have been thoroughly tested so that any defects have
    been fixed before release. EMOD releases undergo full regression testing.

reporter
:   Functionality that extracts simulation data, aggregates it, and saves it as an
    output report. EMOD provides several built-in reporters for outputting data from
    simulations and you also have the ability to create a custom reporter.

reproductive number
:   In a fully susceptible population, the basic reproductive number $R_0$ \ is the number of
    secondary infections generated by the first infectious individual over the course of the
    infectious period. $R_0$=S*L* $\beta$ (where S = the number of susceptible hosts,
    L = length of infection, and $\beta$ = transmissibility). When $R_0$> 1,
    disease will spread. It is essentially a measure of the expected or average outcome of
    transmission. The effective reproductive number takes into account non-susceptible individuals.
    This is the threshold parameter used to determine whether or not an epidemic will occur, and determines:

    * The initial rate of increase of an epidemic (the exponential growth phase).
    * The final size of an epidemic (what fraction of susceptibles will be infected).
    * The endemic equilibrium fraction of susceptibles in a population (1/ $R_0$).
    * The critical vaccination threshold, which is equal to 1-(1/ $R_0$), and
    determines the number of people that must be vaccinated to prevent the spread of a
    pathogen.

routine immunization (RI)
:   The standard practice of vaccinating the majority of susceptible people in a population against
    vaccine-preventable diseases.

scenario
:   A collection of input files that describes a real-world example of a disease outbreak and
    interventions. Scenarios are included with EMOD source installations to help users
    learn more about epidemiology and disease modeling.

schema
:   A text or JSON file that can be generated from the EMOD executable (Eradication.exe) that defines all
    configuration and campaign parameters.

SEIR model
:   A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
    of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
    following four states: susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered.

SEIRS model
:   A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
    of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
    following five states: susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered, and susceptible.

SI model
:   A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
    of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
    following two states: susceptible and infectious.

simulation
:   An execution of the EMOD software using an associated set of input files.

simulation burn-in
:   A modeling concept in which a simulation runs for a period of time before reaching a steady
    state and the output during that period is not used for predictions. This concept is
    borrowed from the electronics industry where the first items produced by a manufacturing
    process are discarded.

simulation type
:   The disease or disease class to model.

    EMOD currently supports the following simulation types for modeling a variety of diseases:

    * Generic disease (GENERIC_SIM), which can be used for modeling a variety of diseases such as
      influenza or measles
    * Vector-borne diseases (VECTOR_SIM), which can be used for modeling vector-borne diseases such as
      dengue
    * Malaria (MALARIA_SIM), which adds features specific to malaria biology and treatment
    * Sexually transmitted infections (STI_SIM), which adds features for sexual relationship
      networks
    * HIV (HIV_SIM), which adds features specific to HIV biology and treatment

SIR model
:   A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
    of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
    following three states: susceptible, infectious, and recovered.

SIRS model
:   A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
    of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
    following four states: susceptible, infectious, recovered, and susceptible.

SIS model
:   A generic epidemiological model that provides a simplified means of describing the transmission
    of an infectious disease through individuals where those individuals can pass through the
    following three states: susceptible, infectious, and susceptible.

solvers
:   Solvers are used to find computational solutions to problems. In simulations, they can be used,
    for example, to determine the time of the next simulation step, or to compute the states of
    a model at particular time steps.

Standard Template Library (STL)
:   A library that contains a set of common C++ classes (including generic algorithms and data
    structures) that are independent of container and implemented as templates, which enables
    compile-time polymorphism (often more efficient than run-time polymorphism). For more
    information and discussion of STL, see [Wikipedia - Standard Template Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library)
    for more information.

state transition event
:   A change in state (e.g. healthy to infected, undiagnosed to positive diagnosis, or birth)
    that may trigger a subsequent action, often an intervention. Campaign events should not be
    confused with state transition events.

stochastic
:   Characterized by having a random probability distribution that may be analyzed statistically
    but not predicted precisely.

stochastic die-out
:   When an disease outbreak ends, despite having an effective $R_0$ above 1, due to
    randomness. A deterministic model cannot estimate the probability of stochastic die-out,
    but a stochastic model can.

subpatent
:   When an individual is infected but asymptomatic, so the infection is not readily detectable.

superinfection
:   The simultaneous infection with multiple strains of the same pathogen.

supplemental immunization activity (SIA)
:   In contrast to routine immunization (RI), SIAs are large-scale operations with a
    goal of delivering vaccines to every household.

susceptible
:   An individual who is able to become infected.

transmissibility ($\beta$)
:   Also known as the effective contact rate, is the product of the contact rate and the
    probability of transmission per contact.

transmission-blocking vaccine (TBV)
:   A vaccine that blocks gametocytes from infected humans by producing viable sporozoites in
    mosquitoes. Also referred to as a "sexual-stage" vaccine, since vaccines in this class block
    gametocytes from infected humans by producing viable sporozoites in mosquitoes.

time step
:   A discrete number of hours or days in which the "simulation states" of all "simulation
    objects" (interventions, infections, immune systems, or individuals) are updated in a
    simulation. Each time step will complete processing before launching the next one. For
    example, a time step would process the migration data for populations moving between nodes
    via rail, airline, and road. The migration of individuals between nodes is the last step of
    the time step after updating states.

tutorial
:   A set of instructions in the documentation to learn more about epidemiology and
    disease modeling. Tutorials are based on real-world scenarios and demonstrate the mechanics
    of the model. Each tutorial consists of one or more scenarios.

vaccine intervention types
:   In EMOD, vaccine interventions are one of four types:

    * AcquisitionBlocking: reduces the acquisition of the pathogen by reducing the force of infection
      experienced by the vaccinated individual.
    * MortalityBlocking: reduces the disease-mortality rate of a vaccinated individual.
    * TransmissionBlocking: reduces pathogen transmission.
    * Generic: reduces transmission, acquisition, and mortality.

virulence
:   The capacity of a pathogen to produce disease. It is proportional to parasitemia, or the
    number of circulating copies of the pathogen in the host. The higher the virulence (given
    contact between susceptible and infectious individuals), the more likely transmission is to occur. However,
    higher virulence means contact may be less likely as infected hosts show more symptoms of
    the disease. There is a trade-off that occurs between high transmissibility and disease-induced
    mortality.

WAIFW matrix
:   A matrix of values that describes the rate of transmission between different population
    groups. WAIFW is an abbreviation for Who Acquires Infection From Whom.

Weibull distribution
:   A probability distribution often used in EMOD that requires both a shape parameter
    and a scale parameter. The shape parameter governs the shape of the density function. When
    the shape parameter is equal to 1, it is an exponential distribution. For shape parameters
    above 1, it forms a unimodal (hump-shaped) density function. As the shape parameter becomes
    large, the function forms a sharp peak. The inverse of the shape parameter is sometimes
    referred to here as the *heterogeneity* of the distribution (heterogeneity = 1/shape),
    because it can be helpful to think about the degree of heterogeneity of draws from the
    distribution, especially for hump-shaped functions with heterogeneity values between 0 and 1
    (i.e., shape parameters greater than 1). The scale parameter shifts the distribution from
    left to right. When heterogeneity is small (i.e., the shape parameter is large), the scale
    parameter sets the location of the sharp peak.

working directory
:   The directory that contains the configuration and campaign files for a simulation. You must
    be in this directory when you invoke Eradication.exe at the command line to run a simulation.

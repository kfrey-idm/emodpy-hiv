class ReportHIVByAgeAndGender(ConfigReporter):
    """
    The age- and gender-stratified HIV report (ReportHIVByAgeAndGender.csv) provides a detailed set of HIV-related
    statistics, with numerous ways to customize and stratify the output. The report format facilitates further analysis
    using a pivot table.

    Some results, such as population size or number infected, are reported as single 'snapshots' at the end of the
    reporting period. Other values, such as deaths or new infections, are aggregated for the entire reporting period.

    For more information, see :doc:`emod-hiv:emod/software-report-age-gender`.

    Args:
        reporters_object (Reporters): The reporters object given by the emodpy.

        collect_gender_data (bool, optional): When True, the 'Gender' column will be added where 0 is for males and 1
            for females.

            Default: False

        collect_age_bins_data (list[float], optional): A list of age bins (values in years) used to stratify the report
            by age. When this parameter is used, the 'Age' column will be added and the reports and will have a row for
            each bin value. The row will include all individuals whose age is between the value in the bin (inclusive)
            and the next bin's value (exclusive). The values between the bins cannot be equal and must be listed in
            ascending order. Leave the array empty to not stratify the report by age. The maximum number of age bins is
            100. Note: setting this will multiply the number of rows in the output report by the number of bins.

        collect_circumcision_data (bool, optional): When True, the 'IsCircumcised' column is included in the output
            report. The report data will be stratified by those who have the MaleCircumcision intervention (1) and
            those who do not (0). Note: setting this to True will double the number of rows for males in the output
            report.

            Default: False

        collect_hiv_data (bool, optional): When True, the 'HasHIV' column is included in the output report. The report
            data will be stratified by those individuals who have HIV (1) and those who do not (0). Cannot be used
            with Report_HIV_ByAgeAndGender_Collect_HIV_Stage_Data. Note: setting this to True doubles the number
            of rows in the output report.

            Default: False

        collect_hiv_stage_data (bool, optional): When True, the 'HIV_Stage' column is included in the output report.
            The report data will be stratified by HIV Infection Stage (NOT_INFECTED, ACUTE, LATENT, AIDS, ON_ART).
            Cannot be used with collect_hiv_data or collect_on_art_data.
            Note: setting this to True multiplies the number of rows in the output report by five.

            Default: False

        collect_on_art_data (bool, optional): When set to True, the 'On_ART' column is included in the output report.
            The report data will be stratified by those individuals who are on ART (1) and those who are not (0).
            Cannot be used with collect_hiv_stage_data. Note: setting this to True doubles the number of rows in the
            output report.

            Default: False

        collect_ip_data (list[str], optional): A list of individual property (IP) keys used to stratify the report.
            A column 'IP_Key:X' will be added to the report for each IP listed, and a row for each possible
            IP Key:Value pair. For more information, see :doc:`emod-hiv:emod/model-properties`.

            Default: None

        collect_intervention_data (list[str], optional): A list of interventions used to stratify the report. This
            allows for reporting on a subset (or all) of the interventions that an individual has been on, of those
            listed in the intervention_name campaign parameter. Those with the intervention will have a 1 in the
            column and those without will have 0. Note: this can only be used with interventions that
            remain with an individual for a period of time, such as VMMC, vaccine/PrEP, or those with a delay state
            in the cascade of care.

            Default: None

        collect_targeting_config_data (list[AbstractTargetingConfig], optional): Creates a 'MeetsTargetingConfig_X'
            column for each targeting config defined in the list where X is the position of the targeting config in the
            list. In cell, value 1 indicates that the individuals match the targeting config and 0 indicating that they
            do not.

            Default: None

        add_transmitters (bool, optional): When True, the 'Transmitters' column will be added to the report. It
            indicates the total number of the individuals in that row who transmitted HIV during this reporting period.
            This may not add up to the number of new infections in the reporting period if any of the new infections
            were due to the OutbreakIndividual intervention or maternal transmission.

            Default: False

        stratify_infected_by_cd4 (bool, optional): When True, the number of infected individuals will be segregated
            into four columns based on CD4 count ('Infected CD4 Under 200 (Not On ART)',
            'Infected CD4 200 to 349 (Not On ART)', 'Infected CD4 350 to 499 (Not On ART)',
            'Infected CD4 500 Plus (Not On ART)')
            Note: this creates additional polling columns, but not more stratification rows.

            Default: False

        event_counter_list (list[str], optional): A list of individual-level events. A column will be added to the
            report for each event listed, showing the number of times the event occurred during the reporting for the
            people in the row. To be counted, the individual must qualify for that row at the time the event occurred,
            not necessarily at the end of the reporting period (the individual themselves might end up being counted
            in a different row). See :doc:`emod-hiv:emod/parameter-campaign-event-list` for events already used by EMOD,
            or add custom events you're using in campaigns.
            parameter in config.

            Default: None

        add_relationships (bool, optional): When True, the report will contain data on the population currently in a
            relationship and ever in a relationship for each relationship type (TRANSITORY, INFORMAL, MARITAL, and
            COMMERCIAL), eight columns total. Additionally, columns containing a sum of individuals in two or more
            partnerships (Has Concurrent Partners) and a sum of the lifetime number of relationships (Lifetime Partners)
            will be included.

            Default: False

        add_concordant_relationships (bool, optional): When True, a Concordant column for each relationship type
            (TRANSITORY, INFORMAL, MARITAL, and COMMERCIAL) is included in the output report. These contain totals for
            each relationship of each type where both partners have the same HIV status.

            Default: False

        reporting_period (float, optional): The number of days between records in output report.
            Note: Due to an old design choice, the reporting_period for his report is halved within EMOD’s code.
            To keep it consistent with other reporters that use reporting periods, emodpy will automatically multiply
            this value by 2 before passing it to EMOD. This means the reporting_period you enter here will correctly
            represent the actual time between report entries, rather than being halved.

            Minimum value: 15
            Maximum value: 182,500
            Default value: 182.5 (every 6 months)

        use_old_format (bool, optional): When True, data collection is offset by one time step: the first entry includes
            an extra time step, and subsequent entries occur at reporting_period but remain offset. This is a
            superseded functionality. When set to False, data is collected as expected - data is collected for and reported
            every reporting_period.

            Default: False

        report_filter (ReportFilter, optional): Common report filtering parameters. Valid filtering parameters for this
            report are:

                - start_year
                - end_year

    """
    The coital act report (RelationshipConsummated.csv) provides detailed information about each coital act that occurs
    during the simulation. The report includes unique identifiers for each coital act and relationship; the relationship
    type, number of acts, whether a condom was used, and whether transmission occurred; and detailed information about
    each participant, including age, gender, infection status, circumcision status, co-infection status, and treatment
    status. Each participant in a relationship is referred to as either participant “A” or participant “B”.

    One row of data is returned per coital act, and results are ordered on a per-relationship basis. Note: if a person
    is engaged in coital acts in multiple relationships during a time step, the order of those acts is unknown, only
    in which relationship they occurred. Additionally, if a person gets infected during a time step, they cannot
    re-transmit that infection during the same time step. The report does record during which coital act transmission
    occurred.

    If an uninfected person has coital acts with multiple infected partners during the same time step, all acts with the
    possibility of transmission are randomly ordered, so that the person has an equal chance of getting infected from
    any one of their partners. The probability of transmission from any one of these coital acts is still determined by
    the simulation parameters (number of acts, acquisition multipliers, etc.)

class InsetChart(_InsetChart):
    """
    The inset chart (InsetChart.json) is an output report that is automatically generated with every simulation. It
    contains simulation-wide averages, one per time step, for a wide number of data channels. The channels are fully
    specified by the simulation type and cannot be altered without making changes to the EMOD source code. Python or
    other tools can be used to create charts out of the information contained in the file.

    For more information, see :doc:`emod-hiv:emod/software-report-inset-chart`

    Args:
        reporters_object (Reporters): The reporters object given by the emodpy
        has_ip (list[str], optional): A channel is added to InsetChart for each value of each
            IndividualProperty key provided.  The channel name will be HasIP_<Key:Value> and will be the fraction
            of the population that has that value for that Individual Property Key. For more information,
            see :doc:`emod-hiv:emod/model-properties`.
            Default: None
        has_interventions (list[str], optional): A channel is added to InsetChart for each intervention name provided.
            The channel name will be Has_<InterventionName> and will be the fraction of the population that has that
            intervention. The intervention_name parameter in the campaigns are the available values for this
            parameter.
            Default: None
        include_pregnancies (bool, optional): If True, channels are added about pregnancies and possible mothers.
            Default: False
        include_coital_acts (bool, optional): If True, include channels about the number of coital acts per relationship
            type per timestep and those using condoms.
            Default: True
        event_channels_list (list[str], optional): This is the list of events included in the InsetChart report. If
            events are specified with this parameter, the InsetChart will include a channel for each event listed.
            If no events are listed, a 'Number of Events' channel will display the total number of all events that
            occurred during the simulation. See :doc:`emod-hiv:emod/parameter-campaign-event-list` for events already
            used by EMOD or add custom events you're using in campaigns.
